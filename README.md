# Database_Environment
This is a database on schema environment created on MariaDB MySQL server. The Entity Relationship(ER) diagram of the schema was created concerning the functional and data requirements of the database.

Then ER diagram is a conceptual design.It is mapped to second normal form (2NF) where normalization helps to eliminate data redundancy and enhance data integrity.

Implementation of the 2NF of the representation data model writing queries and transactions can be performed on different operations.I here have used MariaDB MyySQL server to make the DB.The complexity of the uqeries are tested and reduced with differernt query tuning procedures.
The whole work is included in under the zip file environment.rar.
